# Avalonia Mapping Tools 

Very early (but usable) port of [Mapping Tools](https://github.com/OliBomby/Mapping_Tools) to [AvaloniaUI](https://www.avaloniaui.net/).
This is made for the purpose of running Mapping Tools natively on linux based systems. This also makes it possible to run on MacOS, however I have no way to run and test for any MacOS system.

## Currently Implimented Tools and Features
- Automatic and periodic backups
- [Map Cleaner](https://github.com/OliBomby/Map-Cleaner) by [OliBomby](https://github.com/OliBomby)
